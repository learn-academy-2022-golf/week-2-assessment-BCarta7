# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is a place holder that a function uses for any given argument. The argument is the data itself being fed to the function.

Researched answer: A parameter is a variable used as an alias that is defined in the parenthesis of a function's syntax. An argument is the actual content used when invoking the function.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: It takes value, index, and array. Any one or number of them can be used in the function, but they have to be given as parameters in that order.

Researched answer: The .map built in method takes element, index, and array as predefined parameters, in that order. Only element is required for the function. The parameter names are arbitrary, but the order they are declared in the function is not.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: both iterate through a given array, but .map returns an array with an equal number of elements while filter removes items from the given array, returning a smaller array.

Researched answer: map will perform its inner function on each item in the array as it iterates, and return a new array with the same number of elements. Filter uses the inner function to decide if each element is true or false, and returns an array of only given elements it found true.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Repeating the same process until a certain condition is met.

Researched answer: Iteration is running the same code repeatedly until a condition is met. For example, often done by loops and higher order functions to check or affect each element of an array.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects actually hold the data.

Researched answer: An object is a data type that holds data in key-value pairs, and may perform actions through methods. A class is a template for producing new objects using the constructor method.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: I'm honestly not certain on the terminology of this question at the moment. I'd be happy to research it and get an answer back to you.

Researched answer: Hoisting is a behavior of javascript that moves all declarations of variables "to the top" before running the code, so you can seemingly use variables in code BEFORE the variables have actually been declared.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: An explanation of an application from the view of a user.

2. Spread operator: (...) <-- Even after researching I don't really understand this one yet, but it seems to be a tool for creating a new and identical copy of a given array.

3. React: A javascript library that uses individual and repeatable bits of code called components to create user interfaces and dynamic applications.

4. React props: variables of data or function that can be shared between components through invocation.

5. DOM events: Behaviors that are triggered by user interaction through methods called listeners.
